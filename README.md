# simpleAndroidFreeboxRemote
(Android version of the [iOS app](https://github.com/thomasmunoz13/simpleSwiftFreeboxRemote))

It's a simple Android remote for the [Freebox Player](http://www.free.fr/adsl/freebox-revolution.html), using the HTTP API (which is slowly being deprecated) for channel changing only.
